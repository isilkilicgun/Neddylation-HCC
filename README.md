# Neddylation-HCC
Liver cancer remains a pressing global health challenge and stands as a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, primarily due to late diagnoses and limited therapeutic options. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the predominant form of liver cancer. The quest for effective and targetable biomarkers for HCC, coupled with a comprehensive understanding of its molecular mechanisms, holds promise for advancing treatment methodologies. One pivotal mechanism underpinning this process is post-translational modifications, with neddylation being a notable example. In this study, we meticulously analyzed the expression profiles of NEDD8 and the NEDD8 activating enzyme E1 subunit 1 (NAE1), both integral to the neddylation pathway, across independent HCC datasets. We subsequently discerned their associations with clinicopathological data and prognostic indicators. Notably, both genes exhibited elevated expression in tumor samples compared to their normal adjacent tissues. We then identified differential transcript profiles in patients based on the high and low expression of NEDD8 and NAE1. This was followed by pathway and functional analyses centered on patients with varying expression levels of key neddylation-associated molecules. Concluding our study, in vitro validation experiments were conducted for select molecules. Collectively, our findings posit that during hepatocarcinogenesis, the expression of NEDD8 and NAE1—central to the neddylation mechanism—undergoes significant alterations, potentially correlating with an adverse prognosis in HCC. Moreover, our results bolster the case for therapeutically targeting NEDD8 and NAE1 as a promising avenue for devising effective treatments.
