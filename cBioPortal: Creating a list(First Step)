#Obtaining the list of genes that vary according to NEDD8 and NAE1 expression levels
First, the Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) (372 samples) dataset is selected in cBioPortal.
  Filters:
- Cancer Type Detailed: Hepatocellular Carcinoma
- Tumor Type: Hepatocellular Carcinoma
- Subtype: LIHC
  
Add gene specific charts, with the following specification
NEDD8: mRNA Expression, RSEM (Batch normalized from Illumina HiSeq_RNASeqV2)
NAE1:  mRNA Expression, RSEM (Batch normalized from Illumina HiSeq_RNASeqV2)
These charts can be found at the bottom of the page, where they are grouped by median. Thus, under the mRNA tab, there are separate lists of high and low genes according to NEDD8 and NAE1.
Please select significant only
